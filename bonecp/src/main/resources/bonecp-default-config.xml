		<!-- Sets the name of the pool for JMX and thread names. -->
		<!-- <property name="poolName">(null or no default value)</property> -->

		<!-- Sets the minimum number of connections that will be contained in every partition. 
		     -->
		<property name="minConnectionsPerPartition">20</property>

		<!-- Sets the maximum number of connections that will be contained in every partition. 
		     Setting this to 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique 
		     connections to the database. Note that the connection pool will not create all 
		     these connections in one go but rather start off with minConnectionsPerPartition and gradually 
		     increase connections as required. -->
		<property name="maxConnectionsPerPartition">30</property>

		<!-- Sets the acquireIncrement property.  When the available connections are about to run 
		     out, BoneCP will dynamically create new ones in batches. This property controls how 
		     many new connections to create in one go (up to a maximum of 
		     maxConnectionsPerPartition). Note: This is a per partition setting. -->
		<property name="acquireIncrement">2</property>

		<!-- Sets number of partitions to use.  In order to reduce lock contention 
		     and thus improve performance, each incoming connection request picks off a connection from 
		     a pool that has thread-affinity, i.e. pool[threadId % partition_count]. The higher this number, 
		     the better your performance will be for the case when you have plenty 
		     of short-lived threads. Beyond a certain threshold, maintenance of these pools will start 
		     to have a negative effect on performance (and only for the case when 
		     connections on a partition start running out).  Default: 1, minimum: 1, recommended: 
		     3-4 (but very app specific) -->
		<property name="partitionCount">1</property>

		<!-- Sets the JDBC connection URL. -->

		<!-- Sets the idleConnectionTestPeriod.  This sets the time (in minutes), for a connection 
		     to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB. This is 
		     useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end. Do 
		     not use aggressive values here!  Note: This value only makes sense when 
		     used in conjuction with idleMaxAge.  Default: 240 min, set to 0 to 
		     disable -->
		<property name="idleConnectionTestPeriod">240</property>

		<!-- Sets Idle max age (in min).  The time (in minutes), for a 
		     connection to remain unused before it is closed off. Do not use aggressive 
		     values here!  Note: This value only makes sense when used in conjuction 
		     with idleConnectionTestPeriod.  Default: 60 minutes, set to 0 to disable. -->
		<property name="idleMaxAge">60</property>

		<!-- Sets the connection test statement.  The query to send to the DB 
		     to maintain keep-alives and test for dead connections. This is database specific and 
		     should be set to a query that consumes the minimal amount of load 
		     on the server. Examples: MySQL: "/* ping *\/ SELECT 1", PostgreSQL: "SELECT NOW()". 
		     If you do not set this, then BoneCP will issue a metadata request 
		     instead that should work on all databases but is probably slower.  (Note: 
		     In MySQL, prefixing the statement by /* ping *\/ makes the driver issue 
		     1 fast packet instead. See http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/entry/mysql_tips_for_java_developers ) Default: Use metadata request -->
		<!-- <property name="connectionTestStatement">(null or no default value)</property> -->

		<!-- Sets statementsCacheSize setting.  The number of statements to cache. -->
		<property name="statementsCacheSize">0</property>

		<!-- Sets number of helper threads to create that will handle releasing a connection. 
		      When this value is set to zero, the application thread is blocked 
		     until the pool is able to perform all the necessary cleanup to recycle 
		     the connection and make it available for another thread.  When a non-zero 
		     value is set, the pool will create threads that will take care of 
		     recycling a connection when it is closed (the application dumps the connection into 
		     a temporary queue to be processed asychronously to the application via the release 
		     helper threads).  Useful when your application is doing lots of work on 
		     each connection (i.e. perform an SQL query, do lots of non-DB stuff and 
		     perform another query), otherwise will probably slow things down. -->
		<property name="releaseHelperThreads">3</property>

		<!-- Sets the connection hook.  Fully qualified class name that implements the ConnectionHook 
		     interface (or extends AbstractConnectionHook). BoneCP will callback the specified class according to the

		<!-- Instruct the pool to create a helper thread to watch over connection acquires 
		     that are never released (or released twice). This is for debugging purposes only 
		     and will create a new thread for each call to getConnection(). Enabling this 
		     option will have a big negative impact on pool performance. -->
		<property name="closeConnectionWatch">false</property>

		<!-- If enabled, log SQL statements being executed. -->

		<!-- Sets the Pool Watch thread threshold.  The pool watch thread attempts to 
		     maintain a number of connections always available (between minConnections and maxConnections). This value 
		     sets the percentage value to maintain. For example, setting it to 20 means 
		     that if the following condition holds: Free Connections / MaxConnections < poolAvailabilityThreshold  
		     new connections will be created. In other words, it tries to keep at 
		     least 20% of the pool full of connections. Setting the value to zero 
		     will make the pool create new connections when it needs them but it 
		     also means your application may have to wait for new connections to be 
		     obtained at times.  Default: 20. -->
		<property name="poolAvailabilityThreshold">20</property>

		<!-- If set to true, the pool will not monitor connections for proper closure.

		     jdbcTemplate, some kind of transaction manager, etc). -->

		<!-- Sets the maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait before a call to getConnection

		<property name="connectionTimeout">0</property>

		<!-- Sets properties that will be passed on to the driver.  The properties 
		     handle should contain a list of arbitrary string tag/value pairs as connection arguments; 
		     normally at least a "user" and "password" property should be included. Failure to 
		     include the user or password properties will make the pool copy the values 
		     given in config.setUsername(..) and config.setPassword(..).  Note that the pool will make a 
		     copy of these properties so as not to risk attempting to create a 
		     connection later on with different settings. -->

		<!-- Sets number of statement helper threads to create that will handle releasing a 
		     statement.  When this value is set to zero, the application thread is
